## Implementation Notes

The enrollment CTA was designed to be utlized in templates at the very bottom of every page directly before any site and global footer.  For users that make it to this part of the page, it utilizes our three main CTA for enrollment audiences.

This component is designed to be a full-width (Section).  There is one college variation [enrollment-call-to-action--college](enrollment-call-to-action--college) for pages/sites that may need more college focused CTA wording.
