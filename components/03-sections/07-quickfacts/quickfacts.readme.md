## Implementation Notes

Quickfacts supports 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 different fact variations.  Please note, utilizing our 12-column grid system, it's difficult to accurately support 5 items.  Also, at six, the main headline for each fact is more limited in width even on large desktop screens.

This component is designed to be a full-width (Section) level component and has several different color variations.

TODO: standardize section padding/margin across all color variations.
