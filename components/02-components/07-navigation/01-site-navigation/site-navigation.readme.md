## Notes on conversion to fractal (UTSA ASC adoption)

id="top-header" looks like it should be the new global header, probably need to break this out to a seperate component

## Cascade CMS Considerations

We will be using a predefined block/data definition for a declarative navigation menu.  The navigation system must support both top level links and drop down items (orange triangle next to "Programs").
