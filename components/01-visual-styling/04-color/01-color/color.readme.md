# Notes from Simpson Scarborough Implementation

Most of these color declarations were originally done by the web subcontractor on this project.  As such, knowledge of UTSA colors and naming was minimal.  Items to cover in future updates:

- CSS Variables/SASS Variables
- Renaming to more consistent naming conventions
    - Especially for foreground vs. background and pattern colors
- Reuse these new variables down the line in other components (with SASS)
